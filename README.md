# Sentimental_analysis

## About the project
Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea.


## Project Built on
We have used Naive Bayes model for the prediction of the text. For classifing the sentiment , we have used nltk for calculating the polarity. Using this polarity we classified positive, negative and neutral.
